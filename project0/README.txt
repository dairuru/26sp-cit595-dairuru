In this class, I hope to strengthen my practical software engineering skills by getting more comfortable with the full development workflow—from writing code to testing, version control, and deploying in a consistent environment. Setting up the Git repository taught me how important it is to understand the basics of SSH keys, remotes, and repository initialization, because small configuration gaps can completely block progress.
